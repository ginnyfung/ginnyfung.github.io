										<h1 class="mb-3">Reflection #2</h1>
										<p>Community Service Learning (CSL) is a credited educational experience that is conducted as part of a course, during which students participate in a structured volunteer service (volunteer activities) designed to meet a community need or priority, complete the required volunteer hours, and critically reflect on their in-community placement learning to develop a better understanding of class materials and of their field of study.</p>
										<p>My BIO 2133 CSL placement is partnered with Let’s Talk Science, which is an organization engaged in Science outreach. The intended outcome of Let’s Talk Science is to deliver interactive STEM activities to elementary and high school students, mostly in schools but also in Saturday morning workshops, after school sessions or day events. Due to the pandemic situations and safety concerns, this placement is held virtually, which means that the delivery method of STEM activities is virtual using Zoom or other video conferencing softwares. The goal of this placement is to complete at least 30 hours of volunteer services. At the end of the placement, I should be able to demonstrate the core competencies of (1) Situate theories discussed in class in relevant, “real-world” practical situations (2)Address the relation of service learning to current issues by placing the service activity and the associated student self-reflection at the center of the core (3) Demonstrate professional work habits and ethical conduct when working individually or as part of a team (4) Evalutate one’s own performance in the course and placement and to identify strengths and address personal limitations in conceptual knowledge of genetics and personal study habits (5) Reflect on your sense of social awareness and responsibility by working directly with people in the scientific community or people in need (6) Demonstrate professional work habits and ethical conduct. </p>
										<p>In this placement, I believe I will observe my development of teaching and communication skills. I did my first two activities so far and I was very surprised at how much I have to slow down to explain things or change the lesson plans for the kids. This taught me not to take even the most basic knowledge for granted. I have a sister that is one year younger than me and I am used to speaking to people around the same age as me. I realized that I did not notice this, and started planning the lesson with explanations that probably high school students would understand for kids that are elementary school age. For personal growth, I believe I will be more confident in public speaking. At first, I was a bit nervous that I did not know what to expect for the classes and I was not sure if I am capable of leading a class of elementary school or high school students through hands-on activities. Through the experiences of the two activities that I did so far, I gained confidence and experience in speaking to small groups of students, especially in a virtual setting. I had been a teaching assistant for a language class at an elementary school before, but this virtual classroom setting was a whole new experience. In the in person classes, I could go right next to the students, see their faces, and see whether or not they are good to continue with the next steps. In a virtual setting, although a lot of students do open their camera and microphone, oftentimes I found that there are some barriers that made it a bit harder to communicate with them and see if they are good to start the next step. My next goal is to gain more confidence in speaking virtually with a bigger group of students. In terms of attitudes, I received feedback from Sue about the second activity that I did. Despite some good feedback, there was one mother mentioned that my partner and I should not make comparisons using words like “ugly” with others in the session because this could make children question if theirs is good or not, instead of learning the important science or theory behind the activities. This made me realize how important it is to be a good role model for the children because the small details that we did not even notice impacts them a lot. We want to teach them good attitudes. However, comparisons intended for the learning (like what makes the plane fly better, with stickers or with ribbon?) are good. I will always listen to feedback and try to improve. </p>
										<p>I believe I will establish links between my learning and personal goals to situate theories discussed in class in relevant, “real-world” practical situations. For example there are some genetics related activities, and I could make use of knowledge from what I have learnt during class or in previous science classes about genetics to lead children in activities and explain to them the knowledge in a real-life, hands-on, and simpler way. If the students are interested, I can also try to show them different jobs/careers that relates to the lesson topics. I will also demonstrate professional work habits and ethical conduct by always meeting with my partners for preparation to ensure a smooth session for the children/adult/teachers and showing up about 15 minutes before the sessions to follow the rules that at least two adults must be there and be prepared to start right away when they class is ready without any avoidable technical difficulties. Finally, I will be continuously evaluating my own performance in the course and placement to identify strengths and address personal limitations in conceptual knowledge of genetics and personal study habits through reflections.</p>
										<p>To sum up, I really enjoy this placement so far!</p>
