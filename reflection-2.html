										<h6 style="color:yellow">What professional skills or competencies have you been able to observe?</h6>
										<p style="color:orange">(1)Teaching and communication skills; (2)responsibility; (3)teamwork</p>
										<p style="color:white">For profession skills or competencies, I believe I have observed my development of teaching and communication skills. At the first couple of activities, I was very surprised at how much I have to slow down to explain things or change the lesson plans for the kids. This taught me not to take even the most basic knowledge for granted, and the importance of talking clearly in a way that the audiences understand. I have a sister who is one year younger than me, and I am used to speaking to people around the same age as me. I realized that I did not notice this before, and started planning the lesson with explanations that probably high school students would understand for kids that are elementary school age. Secondly, I have also observed my ability to take on responsibility, which is a key profession competency that a person should have. My responsibility and professional work habits was observed by always meeting with my partners for preparation to ensure a smooth session for the children/adult/teachers and showing up about 15 minutes early for each session to follow the rules that at least two adults must be there and to be prepared to start right away when the class is ready without any avoidable technical difficulties. Lastly, I believe I have improved my teamwork skills. Teamwork is vital because teams that work well together are more efficient. This year, the activity sessions are held virtually due to the pandemic. All of us are working remotely, which makes it more important to be able to reach out and communicate ideas with others. Throughout this CSL course, I have always reached out to my partners to set up for preparation meetings beforehand, and reply to emails within 24 hours. This makes sure that all team members know what is going on for all the activities, which again leads to smoother activity sessions for the kids/students/teachers.

										<h6 style="color:yellow">(1)What links can you establish between your experiences and your initial conception of your future profession? (2)What skills or abilities associated with your future profession and/or career did you use and what was the result?</h6>
										<p style="color:white">Although I am still not sure yet, one of the future professions that I am interested in for the future is being a pharmacist. I am currently working as a pharmacy assistant, and this allows me to observe the pharmacists’ work and working environment on a daily basis. I have observed that interpersonal communication skills are very important for a pharmacist, from counseling patients, communicating with physicians, to interfacing with associates. Through my experiences in volunteering with Let’s Talk Science and hosting activities sessions, I believe I have improved my communication skills by learning how to work/interact with different partners and students/teachers. For pharmacists, it is essential to effectively communicate with patients by providing counsels and education, and working with patients to improve the use of medications and ensure optimal treatment outcomes. In this Let’s Talk Science CSL, volunteers had the opportunity to work with a diverse group of students. This gave me the opportunity to enhance my adaptation skills to work with diverse backgrounds of partners and educators, and skills for educating different grades/styles of students and classes.
